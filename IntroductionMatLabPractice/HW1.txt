Homework 1

Submit two files part1.m and part2.m. Write your name and ID number in BOTH files
email the files to Sepideh Khakzad <sepidehkhakzad@gmail.com>


You must also sign this form and attach it to your emailhttps://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/ginacody/docs/Expectations-of-Originality-Feb14-2012.pdf

Late submissions after the deadline WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

You cannot use ANY function from the image processing toolbox except for imagesc and imshow.



Part I: Matlab

Write a script called part1.m the performs and displays the results of
the following:

1.) Make a 12x12 matrix and fill in with the numbers 1-144 column-wise
(without the use of for loops!). I.E. the first column is 1,2,3,4...
 the second is 13,14,15, .... and so on.

2.) Do the same as question 1 now row-wise.

3.) Using the matrix from question 1, create a new matrix half the
size of the original containing the odd columns and the even rows.

4.) Using the matrix from question 1 create a Boolean matrix (0,1)
indicating the elements greater than 30.

5.) Solve this system:

	X + Y + Z = 9;
	2*X + Y = 3;
	Y + Z = 5;

	This should be done in one short line using matrixes and
	built-in operators.

Part II: Image manipulations

Write a script called part2.m that performs and displays the results of
the following:

For 1 through 4 use the built-in image "peppers.png" to test. To load it, simply type the following:
i_pepper = imread('peppers.png');

1.) Flip an image upside-down.

2.) Take a color image and make it grayscale using equal weights of R,
  G, and B. 

3.) Swap the R and B color channels of an RGB image such that R is now B and
vise versa.

4.) Rotate a grey scale image 90 degrees counter-clockwise. (you cannot use imrotate or rot90)

5.) Create a 12 by 12 by 3 "image" using the matrix from part 1
  question 1.  Now, look at the "reshape" function in matlab using the
  help command. Use reshape to  
    a) convert this matrix to a 144 by 3 matrix.
    b) convert the 144 by 3 matrix back to the original 12 by 12 by 3
       structure.
