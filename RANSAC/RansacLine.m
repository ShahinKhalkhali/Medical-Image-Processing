%   lines = RansacLine(edgeImageIn, noIter, fitDistance, noPts, minD)
%   -   lines is an n by 3 matrix parameterizing lines in the plane
%   -   edgeImageIn is a binary edge image
%   -   noIter is the number of iterations that you have to pick 2 points at random
%   -   fitDistance is the maximum distance a pixel may lie from a line
%   -   noPts is the minimum number of points that should vote for a line. Note that this is different
%       from the implementation discussed in class where we pick the line with max votes. Here, we
%       pick lines that have votes greater than noPts
%   -   minD is the minimum distance between the 2 randomly selected points. This improves
%       RANSACâ€™s performance because if the 2 original points are close, the line fitted can have
%       inaccurate slope.

% Hint hints for your RansacLine function: Use the matlab function "find" to get the
% coordinates of all of the pixel locations corresponding to an edge.

% Note that the number of lines can be different if you run the code again. For example, if we run
% the same code without changing anything, we might get 6 lines.
% To make sure your code is correct, you can test your code with other images, such as:
% inIM = imread('circuit.tif');
% inIM = imread('gantrycrane.png');
